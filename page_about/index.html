        Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere,
        they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact,
        only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found
        in the temperate zone, and one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, lives near the equator.
      </p>
      <p id="otest">
         The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[1]
         on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb).
         The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor),
         also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 cm (16 in) tall
         and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit
         colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate
         or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's rule). Some prehistoric
         species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult
         human. These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,
         subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant
         penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya,
         in a climate decidedly warmer than today.
